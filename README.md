## Hi - I'm Kalyssa.
 I'm a fullstack developer interested in building responsive, scalable systems (bonus points if they involve machine learning).

💻 Technologies & Tools: Python (Flask, TensorFlow), JavaScript (React, Express), Git, AWS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Amazon review sentiment analysis application
- 📖 I’m currently reading When - The Science of Perfect Timing by Daniel Pink
- 🙇🏾‍♀️ I’m looking for help with figuring out the meaning of life 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm pretty obsessed with health & fitness - and I'd like to believe I'd be a gamer if I had a console

Hit me up if you're trying to get me a PS5 🤪
