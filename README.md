## Hi - I'm Kalyssa.
#### I'm a fullstack developer interested in everything from building responsive, scalable systems to mobile development and machine learning (yes I know, that sounds like a lot 😅 - I'm still figuring stuff out)

👩🏾‍💻 Technologies, Tools & Databases: Python (Flask, TensorFlow), JavaScript (React, Express), Git, MongoDB

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Amazon review sentiment analysis application
- 📖 I’m currently reading When - The Science of Perfect Timing by Daniel Pink
- 🙇🏾‍♀️ I’m looking for help with figuring out the meaning of life 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm pretty obsessed with health & fitness - and I'd like to believe I'd be a gamer if I had a console

Hit me up if you're trying to get me a PS5 🤪
